 # Tic Tac Toe

 This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game written in C#.

 ## How to play

 The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

 You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

 The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

 When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
